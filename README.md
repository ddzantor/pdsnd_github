### Project Title
Bikeshare Data Analysis Project

### Description
The Bikeshare Data Analysis Project is a Python script that allows users to explore bikeshare data from different cities, including Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Users can filter the data based on cities, months, and days of the week. The script provides statistical information such as the most common month, day of the week, start hour, popular stations, trip durations, and user demographics.

### Files used
- bikeshare.py (Python script containing the main code)
- chicago.csv (Bikeshare data for Chicago)
- new_york_city.csv (Bikeshare data for New York City)
- washington.csv (Bikeshare data for Washington)
